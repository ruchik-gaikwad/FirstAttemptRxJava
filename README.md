# Async Operation and RxJava 3

#### So, this small piece of Code makes an async call to GitHub, collect the Repos and come back. 
#### So the idea is to spawn a new thread and do the async operations in the new thread and return to main thread when data comes back
#### This is a small attempt to demonstrate async operations in java using RxJava to operation on top it
#### So the main thread never sleeps
